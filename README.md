<center><h1>DISC :: slides-template</h1></center>


This is a barebones template for creating slides using [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/).
It has specific styling hax, _specifically_ for DISC, and they are more or less demonstrated in a "kitchen-sink"-type approach in `index.html`.

Documentation for the library can be found under the `vendor/` directory, if modifications to the configuration or understanding the syntax is required beyond what is already shown.
